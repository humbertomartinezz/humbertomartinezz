                Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) is a powerful approach for monitoring vocal animals
                and their habitats. Spectrograms generated from the recordings of autonomous recording units
                (ARUs), the main instrument used in PAM, can be extracted to interpret unique acoustic data,
                which can help in the conservation efforts of species and ecosystems. However, the use of PAM
                often leads to terabytes of data that need to be processed, and this is often not feasible when
                relying on trained analysts and observers alone. Recently, deep learning models have been
                employed to manually detect and classify species based on their sound. BirdNET, a deep learning
                model, was developed to identify species based on their sound with high accuracy. Previous
                studies have used deep learning models trained on other tasks for classifying and detecting
                species using sound, leaving it unknown whether or not BirdNET can be trained to detect
                non-bird acoustic recordings. In this study, we employed BirdNET for the automated detection
                and supervised classification of non-bird acoustic recordings. Supervised classification uses
                labeled data for the classification task while unsupervised classification data does not have
                labels. Meerkat calls were used for the automated task and cat meows, which were split into
                three different classes based on stimuli performed, were used for the supervised classification
                task. The datasets both originated from open datasets, highlighting the feasibility of performing
                bioacoustics research. A previous deep learning model approach conducted by Morfi et al.
                (2021) was used as a baseline for comparison in this study. Overall, BirdNET outperformed the
                previous deep learning approach in the automated detection and classification of non-bird
                acoustic recordings. This study shares important real-world applications and encourages
                researchers to pursue opportunities in bioacoustics.

            <p class="proj-text"> We were given the option to create a working trebuchet or catapult given various constraints (size, 
                materials, etc.). We chose the trebuchet and decided to make it Angry Birds theme. After contructing the trebuchet, we analyzed 
                total time and distance traveled to see if our launch angle was the most optimal one to get the target to go the farthest. The report <span class="thin-highlight-yellow"><a

            <p class="proj-text"> The task of this project were to create a pair of shoes that were environmentally sustainable. 
                I used various fabrics that produced a low carbon footprint, like cotton and linen canvas fabrics, which also helped with
                the durability of the shoe. My shoes had a similar texture to that of a canvas tote bag. I created shoe lasts for 
                this project so I could get the most accurate shape of my foot when creating the shoes. All the other materials used in my shoes were recycled.
                CO2 emissions for my shoe is 16.66 kg of CO2 per shoe.
