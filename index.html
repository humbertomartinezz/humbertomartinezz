    <p class="intro"><i>Hi everyone!</i> I'm Humberto, a first-generation student from Michoacán, México and live in Flowery Branch, Georgia. I'm part of
        Flowery Branch High School's STEAM class of 2024 and Columbia University's class of 2028. I love to
        learn anything related to computer science and STEM. I spend my free time exploring new coffee shops, admiring nature, and making new Spotify playlists. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I plan to major in Computer Science at the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) at Columbia University. My ambition lies in delving deep into the intersection of Computer Science, 
        with a focus on machine learning, and Biology. I'm an incoming Software Engineer Intern at Amazon and I'm eager to see how this opportunity enriches my studies 
        in Computer Science. <br />Feel free to email me at <span

                In this study, BirdNET was employed for the automated detection and supervised classification of non-bird acoustic recordings. 
                Meerkat calls were used for the automated task and cat meows, which were split into three different classes based on stimuli performed, were used for the supervised classification task. 
                The datasets both originated from open datasets, highlighting the feasibility of performing bioacoustics research. 
                A previous deep learning model approach conducted by Morfi et al. (2021) was used as a baseline for comparison in this study. 
                Overall, BirdNET outperformed the previous deep learning approach in the automated detection and classification of non-bird acoustic recordings.
